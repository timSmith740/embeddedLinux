# embeddedLinux
Pictures for the cross-compiled helloWorld.c are included.
 And a Makefile is included with multiple options and rules.
 Also I downloaded and compiled the new kernel.
 
A webpage for contacting the phant webserver for collecting data. I think I am going to
run it overnight to collect more data. The javascript file is included.
