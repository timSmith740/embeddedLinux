I have finished the javascript, mmap, and pru sections. If you compile the gpiommap.c and execute it should work.

I've tested the three above on a scope pictures of the scope readings will be included.

Time difference for javascript: 1.22ms
Time difference for mmap: 23.6us
Time difference for pru: 184 ns

I still plan on trying to finish it up
