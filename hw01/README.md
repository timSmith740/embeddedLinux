I have done steps 1,3,4,5,6,and 7.

I do not have the labels to attach to my Beaglebone right now.

After compiling my code and running the executable. You can move the cursor by typing in l,r,u,or d.
That will move the cursor in the left, right, up, or down direction respectively. It will update the board after you input your command.

You can also type in c and it will clear the board, but leave the cursor where it was.

You can quit the program by typing in q.
